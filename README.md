# LanguageChatsim
## Project Information
This repository hosts the Language Chatsim project which is a collaborative effort between the Emerging Media Lab, UBC IT Department, and UBC English Language Institute. The project goal is to eventually develop a Virtual Reality (VR) environment where any student at UBC can practice orally communicating with an AI Chatbot in any language of their choice. This will help supplement the language program at UBC and fill a large gap present when trying to learn a language. Which is the application and experience with orally communicating within the language.
